# color-blindless-approximation

This project aims to implement a neural network to automatically correct colors in images to improve their visual perception for people with color blindness. The model is trained on input images for the three main types of color blindness: protanopia (red-green), deuteranopia (red-green), and tritanopia (blue-yellow).
